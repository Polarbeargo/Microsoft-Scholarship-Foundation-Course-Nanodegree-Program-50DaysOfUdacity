* Reading Lesson 2 Introduction to Machine Learning section 20 Linear Regression.
* I very love the Text data section where I have chance to read how to process text data with normalization(Lemmatization, Tokenization) and Vectorization where 
  I got understand about:
    * Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization
    * Word embedding, as done with Word2vec or Global Vectors (GloVe)
* Section 8 Scaling data with Standardization and Normalization where I'm very glad that I have chance to read this section :)
